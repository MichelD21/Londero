Step-by-step usage and settings for the scripts used in the Encounter RTL logic synthesis tool:

1- In the home of the user (~), create a new directory named "sources";
2- Copy the following files to the ~/sources directory:
	- constraints.sdc;
	- rc.tcl;
	- path.tcl;
	- tech.tcl;
	Note: Any of the above files provided with a different name must be renamed to fit this README.
3- Create a directory named as the top entity of the hierarchy to be synthetized (minus .vhd/.v);
4- Copy your project Verilog and VHDL source files to the directory created in step (3). Internal directory hierarchy may be kept;
5- Copy the "rcLogicSyn.sh" script file to your home directory;
6- Using a terminal on your home directory, call the script using the following syntax:
	. rcLogicSyn.sh [top] [frequency] [clock] [reset]
	Where [top] is the same name used in step (3), [frequency] is the target synthesis frequency in MHz (1 MHz = 1e6 Hz), and
	[clock] and [reset] are the name of the clock signal and the reset signal respectively used in the top Verilog/VHDL file.

After completion, the following reports may be found under ~/[top]/trunk/backend/synthesis/reports/ :

area.rpt	- Total and instances area;
power.rpt	- Total and instances power;
gates.rpt	- Number of times each cell was instanced; 
drc.rpt		- Whether any or none of the DRC rules were violated;
timing.rpt	- Magnitude of the abscence/presence of timing violations, along with the critical path;

For further clarification, following is an example of usage:
	
	Name of the top entity: rayTriangle_intersection.vhd
	Desired synthesis frequency: 250 MHz
	Clock and reset signal names: clk, rst
	
	In the home (~) directory, open a terminal and type:
	. rcLogicSyn.sh rayTriangle_intersection 250 clk rst
